# Sort-Master-A-Dynamic-Sorting-Algorithm-Interface-using-Assembly-Language
SortMaster is an interactive console-based application designed to demonstrate the implementation of various sorting algorithms in assembly language. Built using Irvine32.inc, this project offers users a hands-on experience in selecting and executing sorting algorithms on an array of integers. The user-friendly interface allows the user to choose from five commonly used sorting methods: Bubble Sort, Heap Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Selection Sort. Once the algorithm is selected, the program sorts the array and displays the result, enhancing understanding of how these algorithms work at a low level. SortMaster is an ideal tool for learning about sorting algorithms and exploring their performance through assembly programming.
